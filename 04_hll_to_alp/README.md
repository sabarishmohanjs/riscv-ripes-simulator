### RISC-V Assembly Language (ALP) Code

The `.s` file in this folder contains the corresponding RISC-V assembly language code.

---

### Explanation of the ALP Code

This program performs two arithmetic operations.

* It loads pre-defined integer values from the `.data` section into registers.
* It calculates `(b - c)` and `(g + h) - (i + j)`.
* The results are stored in the memory locations `out_a` and `out_f`.
* The program concludes by entering an infinite loop.

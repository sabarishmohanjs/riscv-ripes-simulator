### RISC-V Assembly Language (ALP) Code

The `.s` file in this folder contains the corresponding RISC-V assembly language code.

---

### Explanation of the ALP Code
1. In RISC-V assembly language, only single-line comments are used. They begin with a hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line.
2. The assembly language program stores the intermediate results in the saved registers.
3. The temporary registers can also be used to save the intermediate results.
